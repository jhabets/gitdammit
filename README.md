GitDammit
=========

A simple git client for artists and designers.  

The one true git client is the command line, but GitDammit is for people that don't feel comfortable with a command line.

GitDammit primarily is concerned with managing files.  
* Typical path is untracked > tracked > committed > pushed to remote

Current Features:
* watches a hardcoded path to a local git repository  (C:Projects/ChubbyDragons)
* counts number of untracked vs tracked files
